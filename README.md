## This is a React JS project

What I used:

babel   
webpack   
react    
react-router    
axios    
scss    
webpack-dev-server    


I did not use `create-react-app` this time. So the file structure in dist folder might be kinda messy.

Will fix this later and try to integrate Redux into this project.
