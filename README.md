## This is a React JS project

What I used:

babel   
webpack   
react    
react-router    
axios    
scss    
webpack-dev-server    


I did not use `create-react-app` this time. So the file structure in dist folder might be kinda messy.

Will fix this later and try to integrate Redux into this project.

If you want to preview it live, here is the link:

I used [cross origin anywhere](https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/) to send requests and it sometimes does not work properly.

If that is the case you can simply download this repo and `npm install` --> `npm start` (Note: you need to setup proxy in webpack.config.js though)

Have a nice day!
